                    I recently graduated with a Computer Science degree, focusing on projects that blend user interaction with cutting-edge technology. One notable project was a smart chess board I developed using embedded Rust, which automatically identifies piece positions and suggests valid moves to players. My enthusiasm for embedded development drives me to create practical, innovative solutions.

                    Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to bring my skills to a team that values groundbreaking work in embedded systems.
